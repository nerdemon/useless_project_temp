### Project Description
what we tried to built A quirky weather alert system that not only warns you about rain and wind but does it with personality and humor ‚Äî because who said weather alerts have to be boring?

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Why settle for boring weather updates when you could get alerts that warn you about flying mangoes, dropping coconuts, and other surprising hazards? Avoiding unexpected falling fruit is a serious challenge, yet nobody talks about the trauma of getting bonked by nature‚Äôs surprises!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A smart weather alert system that uses live weather data to send personalized, fun, and practical alerts about rain and wind, helping users avoid falling coconuts mangoes etc.
